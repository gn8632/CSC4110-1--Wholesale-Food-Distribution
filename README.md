# Wholesale Food Distribution 
CSC 4110-1 software engineering final team project. 

My team and I created a desktop application for WSU Inc. wholesale Food Distribution. The company buys the product from many different vendors and sells them to retail customers. The company manages all its operations paper-based. The purpose of this project is to create a desktop application so that the company can manage all operations electronically. 

The features of this project are login and log out, customer profiles, vendor profiles, item profiles, purchase orders, customer orders, and customer invoices.
